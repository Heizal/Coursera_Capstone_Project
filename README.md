# Coursera_Capstone_Project

For my Capstone Project, I used the training set of from the **Loan_Data_csv** to build an accurate model. 

Then I used the test set created to report the accuracy of the model with the following algorithms:

<li>K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<br></br>

**To test the accuracy of the models from each algorithm I also used the:**
<li>F-1 Score</li>
<li>Jaccard Index</li>
<li>log-loss</li>
